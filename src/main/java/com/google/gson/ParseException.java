/**
 * This exception should be raised if there is a serious issue that occurs
 * during parsing.  One of the main usages for this class will be for the
 * GSON infrastructure.  If the incoming JSON is bad/malicious, an instance
 * of this exception should be raised.
 *
 * This is a runtime exception because this is exposed to the client.  Using
 * a RuntimeException avoids bad coding practices on the client side where
 * they catch the exception and do nothing.  It is often the case that you
 * want to blow up if there is a Parse Exception (i.e. most likely client
 * code will never know how to recover from a {@link ParseException}.
